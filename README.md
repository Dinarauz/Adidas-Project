**Key Objectives:**
For this project, I stepped into the role of a data analyst at Adidas, with a goal to understand waht's really driving sales across regions, what products, places and people. I used csv file which I have extracted from Kaggle dates from 01/2020 to 01/2022(can't seem to find the author of the data). First I have removed the null values, renamed, and converted the data types. Then I started to work on key questions.

**Key Business Questions for Analysis:**

**1. Top Performing Products by Channel and Profitability**
Which products are sold the most by each sales method (online vs in-store)
Which product categories contribute the most to operating profit?
How do product sales and profits vary across different departments or regions?

**2. Retail Sales Performance**
Which retailer generates the highest and lowest total sales?
How does each retailer perform in terms of operating profit and sales volume?

**3. Geographic Sales Insights**
Which states and cities generate the highest total sales?
Are there specific regions that consistently outperform others in terms of sales or profitability? (Which retailers dominate in different regions?)

**4. Category-Specific Performance**
Which cities have the highest sales for Women’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel?

**5. Seasonality & Trends**
Are there seasonal patterns in total sales and product performance??

**6. Sales Efficiency**
What is the average price per unit sold per category?

**Key Findings**
One product stood out above the rest: Men’s Street Footwear — Adidas’s top performer in both unit sales and operating profit. It was closely followed by Men’s Athletic Footwear and Women’s Apparel, each selling around 400,000 units. Surprisingly, even though Women’s Apparel sold the same number of units as Men’s Athletic Footwear, it generated significantly more profit — hinting at stronger margins or more efficient sales.

On the flip side, Men’s Apparel consistently underperformed across all metrics. It ranked lowest in unit sales and had especially weak performance in regions like the Midwest, where even footwear did better. Across all states, Women’s Athletic Footwear showed up as the least-sold category, suggesting a broader trend in consumer preferences.

Regionally, the West led demand, particularly for Men’s Street Footwear, followed by the Northeast and Midwest. At the state level, New York, Florida, California, Texas, and South Carolina made up Adidas’s top five markets by sales, while Nebraska recorded the lowest profit overall.

Retailer performance was equally telling. West Gear and Foot Locker topped the list, while Amazon and Walmart fell behind. Even so, Kohl’s held a strong middle ground with nearly 300,000 units sold. These patterns suggest clear opportunities: double down on strong partners, and re-energize weaker channels with exclusive product drops or limited-edition releases to spark interest.

Looking at the big picture, sales trends revealed a clear spike in early 2021, with most categories showing steady growth through the end of the year. That followed a noticeable dip in mid-2020 — likely pandemic-related. Interestingly, Men’s Athletic Footwear remained stable throughout, showing consistent demand even as other categories fluctuated.

In short, the data tells a story of product strength, untapped potential, and smart opportunities. Adidas could benefit from investing more in what’s working — like footwear and strong regional markets — while rethinking how to position underperformers like Men’s Apparel, perhaps with fresh designs, influencer campaigns, or limited releases to bring the brand back into the spotlight. Especially Adidas has done that before with Equipment and Stella McCartney. Next step would be to see the data from the special release and collabs to see if Men's Apparel as well as Women's Athletic Footwear sales has changed if it did. Then it might be a time for a new collab.
