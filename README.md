**Key Objectives:**
In this project, I used csv file which I have extracted from Kaggle dates from 01/2020 to 01/2022(can't seem to find the author of the data). First I have removed the null values, renamed, and converted the data types. Then I started to work on key questions.

**Key Business Questions for Analysis:**

**1. Top Performing Products by Channel and Profitability**
Which products are sold the most by each sales method (online vs in-store)
Which product categories contribute the most to operating profit?
How do product sales and profits vary across different departments or regions?

**2. Retail Sales Performance**
Which retailer generates the highest and lowest total sales?
How does each retailer perform in terms of operating profit and sales volume?

**3. Geographic Sales Insights**
Which states and cities generate the highest total sales?
Are there specific regions that consistently outperform others in terms of sales or profitability? (Which retailers dominate in different regions?)

**4. Category-Specific Performance**
Which cities have the highest sales for Women’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel?

**5. Seasonality & Trends**
Are there seasonal patterns in total sales and product performance??

**6. Sales Efficiency**
What is the average price per unit sold per category?

**Key Findings**
My analysis revealed that Men’s Street Footwear is Adidas’s top-selling product, followed by both Men’s Athletic Footwear and Women’s Apparel, each selling around 400,000 units. On the other end of the spectrum, Men’s Apparel had the lowest sales overall, just below Women’s Athletic Footwear.

When analyzing operating profit, Men’s Street Footwear again came out on top, followed closely by Women’s Apparel. This is notable because even though Men’s Athletic Footwear and Women’s Apparel sold a similar number of units, Women’s Apparel was significantly more profitable, suggesting higher margins or more efficient sales channels.

From a regional perspective, Men’s Street Footwear saw the highest demand in the West, followed by the Northeast and Midwest. Interestingly, Men’s Apparel had the lowest demand overall, especially in the Midwest, even though Adidas generally performed better in footwear sales in that region compared to the South and Southeast. Apparel, in particular, struggled in the Midwest.

Looking at state-level performance, the top five states by total sales were New York, Florida, California, Texas, and South Carolina. In contrast, Nebraska recorded the lowest total operating profit. A consistent trend across all states was that Women’s Athletic Footwear was the least-sold category.

In terms of retailer performance, West Gear led the way in total units sold, followed by Foot Locker, Sports Direct, and Kohl’s. Amazon had the lowest sales volume. That said, Kohl’s still moved nearly 300,000 units, which is solid. Walmart and Amazon trailed behind with approximately 200,000 units each. Based on this, Adidas should continue strengthening its partnerships with high-performing retailers like West Gear and Foot Locker. For underperformers like Amazon and Kohl’s, Adidas could explore short-term promotional campaigns or limited-edition sneaker drops to boost engagement and sales.

From a time-based perspective, there was a notable spike in sales starting January 2021, with most product categories showing consistent growth through the end of the year. Men’s Street Footwear and Women’s Apparel emerged as the leading categories during this period. Conversely, mid-2020 saw a dip across all categories — likely due to seasonal factors or pandemic-related disruptions. One category that remained relatively stable throughout was Men’s Athletic Footwear, which held a steady position despite market fluctuations. So Adidas needs to keep up creating amazing sneakers since there's high demand for the Men's Athletic Footwear and create more limited edition clothing with influencers or stars to get more attention for their Men's Apparel.
