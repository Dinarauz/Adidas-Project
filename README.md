## Product Performance & Regional Sales Insights (2020 - 2022)
Analyzed Adidas sales data to figure out what's actually selling, where, and through which channels. Found some clear winners (Men's Street Footwear) and some categories that need work (Men's Apparel).

**Key Business Questions for Analysis:**

**1. Product Performance:**
• Which products sell best by channel (online vs in-store)?
• What categories make the most profit?
• How do sales vary across regions?

**2. Retail & Geographic:**
• Which retailers are crushing it and which aren't?
• What states and cities generate the most sales?
• Are there regional patterns worth noting?

**3. Market Trends:**
• Any seasonal patterns in sales?
• What's the average price per unit by category?

**Key Findings**
**Clear Winner:** Men's Street Footwear dominated everything highest units sold and best operating profit. Men's Athletic Footwear and Women's Apparel each sold around 400K units, but Women's Apparel generated way more profit despite the same volume. Better margins or smarter pricing.

**Underperformers:** Men's Apparel struggled across the board lowest sales and especially weak in the Midwest. Women's Athletic Footwear was consistently the least-sold category nationwide.

**Regional Breakdown:**
• West region led demand, especially for Men's Street Footwear
• Top 5 states: New York, Florida, California, Texas, South Carolina
• Nebraska had the lowest profit overall

**Retailer Performance:**
• Winners: West Gear and Foot Locker
• Middle: Kohl's (solid ~300K units)
• Lagging: Amazon and Walmart

**Trends Over Time:**
• Big spike in early 2021
• Mid-2020 dip (probably pandemic-related)
• Men's Athletic Footwear stayed stable throughout while other categories fluctuated
• Steady growth through end of 2021

## Technical Details
**Code:** https://github.com/Dinarauz/Adidas-Project/blob/main/Adidas_Project_Final.ipynb

**Data Source:** Kaggle dataset (2020 - 2022 sales records)

**Analysis Process:**
• Cleaned data: removed nulls, standardized column names, fixed data types
• Used pandas for data manipulation and pivot tables
• Created multiple visualizations with seaborn, matplotlib, and bokeh
• Built 6 separate Tableau dashboards + Power BI report

**Tools Used:**
•	Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn, requests, panel, bokeh, matplotlib) – for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. -Grouped the data, used Pivot tables
•	Jupyter Notebook for organizing and running the analysis.
•	Tableau Public – for interactive dashboard development
• Power Bi visualization

## Business Recommendations
1. **Double down on footwear:** Men's Street Footwear is clearly the cash cow  keep investing here
2. **Fix Men's Apparel:** This category needs a refresh - maybe limited drops, influencer collabs, or new designs
3. **Regional focus:** Push harder in the West and top 5 states where demand is proven
4. **Retailer strategy:** Strengthen partnerships with West Gear and Foot Locker, figure out why Amazon/Walmart underperform
5. **Women's Athletic Footwear:** Nationwide underperformer - needs marketing attention or product redesign

## Next Steps
Look at special releases and collab data to see if limited editions moved the needle for underperforming categories. Adidas has done this successfully before with Equipment and Stella McCartney lines worth seeing if that strategy works for Men's Apparel and Women's Athletic Footwear.
